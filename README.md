My first repository to learn the gist of GitHub!

Hello Hubbers!

If you're reading this, I apologize, for I am but an expirimental repository for Nanci to play around with. Who is Nanci? She's my human. She's pretty funny. She likes to crack jokes, paint, use mixed media for art projects, play video games, travel, cook, read, watch movies, and play with her dog. What she lacks in height, she makes up in personality. She's been working at various jobs since she was 16, but by far her happy place for work is building communities and engaging with developers. She's been involved in the developer community since 2005, and hopes to one day bring her experience to GitHub.
